# Surfs Up

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

In this assignment, we are helping an investor, who is interested in funding a surf business but scared to potential loss due to bad weather,  to analyze a set of historical weather data in a given period of time at a specific region. The purpose of this assignment is to summarize some of the key points in the historical June and December data, and make some business suggestions based on the interpretation from this data analysis.

## Three key points from June and Dec data

According to the statistics summary, we have the following findings. 

![]()
1) In both June and Dec dataset, the mean is almost equal to its median. In Dec’s data summary, the means is 71.0415 and the median is 71. In Dec data summary, the mean is 74.9441 and the median is 75. This finding shows that both June and Dec data are symmetric 
2) In both June and Dec datasets, the min value and max value seem to be far away from the rest of the data. In Dec’s data summary, the min is 64 and the max is 85. In Dec data summary, the min is 56 and the max is 83. This finding shows that in both June and Dec weather data have a history to have extreme value (weather). 
3) Dec data shows a larger standard deviation than June data. This means that the Dec data has greater spread from mean in the data than June data



### Suggestions and two additional queries

In general, the data from month of June and Dec shows a tendency of symmetric data. The mean and the median are similar from both datasets. There is noticeable outlier in both datasets as both min and max value for each sets are extreme, indicating that there is hirotry for extreme weather for both months.

I would suggest to include the two additional queires:

the queries that filter the station table to retrieve temperature for different latitude. These will help us to understand how the latitude effect the temperature according to the history data and will help us to invest the business in the location that is most stable in terms of temperature 
The queries that filter station table to retrieve temperature for different longitude. These will help us to understand how the longitude effect the temperature according to the history data.


With the above two additional queries, we will understand where to invest the business and how to find the location that is most stable in terms of temperature
